## **Description**

Mutethya's Photography Portfolio is a clean, responsive website designed to display my photography work. It includes sections like **Home**, **About**, **Services**, and **Contacts**. The website is designed to provide potential clients with an overview of the services I offer and examples of my photography, all while being user-friendly and visually appealing.

The site allows users to view a gallery of photos, read about me, explore the services offered, and find ways to contact me. The layout is responsive, making it easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile devices.

## **Design plan**

The design plan of this website was created and used as a layout guide of the steps I will be taking as I make it

## **Known Bugs**

- **Responsive Layout**: The layout works well on most screen sizes, but there may be slight adjustments needed for very small screens (e.g., mobile view).
- **Image Quality**: Some images may appear pixelated on larger screens if high-resolution images are not used.

There are currently no critical bugs affecting the main functionality of the website.

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the webpage, including the navigation, content, and gallery.
- **CSS3**: Styled the layout, typography, and photo gallery. Used **Flexbox** for navigation and **Grid** for the image gallery.
- **Google Fonts**: Integrated various fonts like Dancing Script, Roboto, and Euphoria Script for a more polished design.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilized CSS media queries for mobile responsiveness.
